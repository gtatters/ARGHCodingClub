This is the analysis that accompanies the blogpost [SPSS is dying. R is surging.](http://lindeloev.net/spss-is-dying-r-takes-the-lead-in-2020/)

To redo the analysis:
 * Run the scholar scraper which saves *citations.csv*. Note that Google Scholar will block you after around ~20 searches, so only do a few each day.
 * Go to [trends.google.com](trends.google.com) and download the trends for some packages. Rename the .csv to *trends.csv' and edit it to be proper in a proper format (remove the first two lines)
 * Run *graphs.r* to reproduce the graph.
