## ARGH Coding Club

- Our mission is to facilitate a collaborative and supportive environment where students, post-docs, and faculty may develop data analysis, graphical, programming, and statistics skills together, using R. 

- We want to replace statistics anxiety or code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn.

## Content 

- If willing, each week, a lead presenter demonstrates code for a graphical, statistical, or analytical problem they have mastered or are currently working on.  Presenters may use their own data or data from published sources.

- If no presenters, then the sessions will be R help sessions for fellow researchers. 

- Data and code examples may be uploaded to this site, so be able to provide sample datasets if necessary. 


## When, Where

- Schedule: Every other monday, starting Monday, January 6
- Time: 12 - 1 pm (unless otherwise noted) 
- Location: Digital Scholarship Laboratory

## Details

- Bring your laptop with R/Rstudio installed
- Bring current problems or challenges in R you need help with
- Bring novel solutions in R you want to share
- Be willing to help others with R solutions
