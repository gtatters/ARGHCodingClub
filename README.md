## ARGH Coding Club

Our mission is to facilitate a collaborative and supportive environment where students, post-docs, and faculty may develop data analysis, graphical, programming, and statistics skills together, using R. 

We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn, and here we will share our experience.
